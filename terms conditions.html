We have discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon our own determination.The DMCA provides recourse for intellectual property owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under RSA law. If you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Service infringe your intellectual property rights, then you (or your agent) may send us a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:</p>
